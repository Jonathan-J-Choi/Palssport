## General Info

This application is intended for the casual traveler or the international business person. Our application gives the user ticket prices and a dozen useful phrases for a specified location.

## Instructions

In order to use the application, be sure to install all of the dependencies (see below). If the user would like to test in development, they must first start the server connection via Node, and then run http://localhost8080. Be sure to copy and paste our schema file into MySQL Workbench! From there, the user will decide where they would like to go, and their point of origin. If the user would like to see the database, use our api routes of /:countryname, this will display the table of all 12 need-to-know phrases in the specified country's native tongue.
